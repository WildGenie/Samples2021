# How to improve Automated Machine Learning Performance

## Speed up AutoML run in CPU based model

## Use Case

- Improve model training time
- Using CPU
- Adding more nodes
- increase concurrency
- Optimize for cost
- Test regression model

## Introduction

- Choose NasaPred data from data.gov
- Remaining useful life model using regression
- Run with 2 Training Cluster configuration
    - Compute-Cluster called cpu-cluster1 with 2 node Standard_D14_v2 (16 cores, 112 GB RAM, 800 GB disk)
    - Compute-Cluster called cpu-cluster with 4 nodes Standard_F16s_v2 (16 cores, 32 GB RAM, 128 GB disk)
- Same dataset
- Same regression model
- Same default configuration
