 Software/data/BI applications                  , DataScience Application - Machine Learning and AI             
 Development environment can have fake data     , Development environment need's production actual data         
 Can have small subset of data to develop logic , Volume of data is high                                        
 Don't need large volume of data                , Time consuming based on how much data is used to build models 
 Don't need production data                     , Iterative process                                             
 Low compute power                              , Need large compute power                                      
 Mostly cpu based                               , GPU/FPGA/Tensor
