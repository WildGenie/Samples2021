# How to be sustainable in Machine learning using cloud

## Sustabilibity with machine learning

## Introduction

Sustainability is a key area of focus on how we save planet earth. What does this means is how to we reduce carbon footprint.
There are many ways to do achieve this. But my focus is going to be using adhoc or on demand compute machine learning.

By using compute when needed and not running all the time we consume electricity and also carbon produced by computers.
Instead of running 24 hours we use only when needed. For example if the model runs for 4 hours a day then we save 20 hours
that we can save carbon and also cost.

This technique can also apply for big data, data processing as far as we split the storage and compute. This is also possible for machine learning and AI.

This techniques is for any cloud and something what we can control. Every cloud provider will have their own sustainbility design to provide less carbon footprint.

When we use streaming or event based processing there is not much savings on carbon other than the computer manufacturer building computers that consume less energy and produce less carbon.

For ML by filtering unwanted data and controling experiment run might save carbon footprint. Given the automl these days by setting max run time can be used to stop the unwanted run.
