# Using Autonomous systems for automation using bonzai

## How to optimize your automation using bonzai machine teaching platform

## Architecture

- Bonsai platform allows us to automate control system operations
- By designing the control system using engineering tool to simulate the control system.
- Based on the simulation bonzai training platform allows us to learn and build a model
- Details available - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/autonomous-systems/intro-to-project-bonsai/1-introduction
- i believe this is the next generation of automation taken to a next level
- Any large scale production can take advantage of this system

- Systems helps you optimize
    - Process variables
    - Improved production efficiency
    - Reduce downtime
- System has 3 components
    - Integrate
    - Training
    - Export
